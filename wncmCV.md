Summary
-------

**In process of rewriting**

I am currently in my first year at Edinburgh University reading Computer Science.

I am currently in my gap year before going to Edinburgh University to read Computer Science
in 2014. I am looking to earn some money to fund a trip to North America next year, as well
as getting some useful work experience. My teachers said I was “interesting, thoughtful,
and talented” with “a sharp mind” and they enjoyed teaching me.
