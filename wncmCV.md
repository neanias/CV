# Summary

I am currently in my gap year before going to Edinburgh University to read Computer Science in 2014. I am looking to earn some money to fund a trip to North America next year, as well as getting some useful work experience. My teachers said I was “interesting, thoughtful, and talented” with “a sharp mind” and they enjoyed teaching me.
